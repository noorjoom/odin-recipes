        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Make sure your rice is cooked and cold. This will help prevent the rice from getting mushy during the frying process. Leftover rice that's been refrigerated works best.</li>
            <li><strong>Scramble the Eggs:</strong> In a wok or a large skillet, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Pour in the beaten eggs and scramble them until fully cooked. Remove them from the pan and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook Vegetables:</strong> In the same pan, add a bit more oil if necessary, then toss in the onions and garlic. Sauté until the onions become translucent. Add the mixed vegetables and continue to sauté until they are tender.</li>
            <li><strong>Rice Time:</strong> Add the rice to the pan. Use a spatula to break apart any clumps. Stir fry the rice, ensuring it mixes well with the vegetables.</li>
            <li><strong>Season:</strong> Drizzle soy sauce over the rice and mix well. Season with salt and pepper. If you're using a low-sodium soy sauce, you might need more salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Final Touches:</strong> Add the scrambled eggs back into the pan. If you're using any proteins (chicken, shrimp, etc.), add them in now. Stir everything together.</li>
            <li><strong>Garnish:</strong> Sprinkle the sliced green onions on top for a burst of color and freshness.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Dish out the fried rice onto plates or into bowls, and serve hot!</li>
        </ol>
