        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix together all the marination ingredients. Add the chicken pieces and ensure they're well-coated. Cover and let it marinate for at least 1 hour, though overnight is best.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the Rice:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash the basmati rice until the water runs clear, then soak it in water for about 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, bring 4-5 cups of water or chicken broth to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and the soaked rice. Cook the rice until it's 70% done (it should still have a bite to it). Drain the excess water and set the rice aside.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or pan, heat the oil or ghee. Add the sliced onions and fry them until they turn golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Add the bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Fry for a minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the marinated chicken to the pot. Cook on high heat for 2-3 minutes, then reduce the heat to medium and cover the pot. Let the chicken cook until it's almost done.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Layer and Cook the Biryani:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the chicken is almost cooked, layer the partially cooked rice on top of the chicken.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro and mint leaves. You can also add a few saffron strands soaked in milk for additional color and flavor.</li>
                    <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. If you don't have one, you can use a flat pan or tava (griddle) and place the pot on top of it. This will ensure even heating and prevent direct contact with the high flame.</li>
                    <li>Cook on low heat for 25-30 minutes. This process allows for the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Serve:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once cooked, let the biryani rest for about 10 minutes before fluffing the rice. Serve the chicken biryani with raita, salad, or a side of your choice.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This is a simplified version of the traditional Biryani. The traditional method might involve more steps like using a dough seal for the pot or using more spices. However, this recipe is meant to make the process more accessible while retaining the core flavors of the dish.</em></p>
